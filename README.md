### Hi, my name is Ché Salazar and I'm currently studying at the University of The West Indies.
### I am currently in pursuit of my Bachelor's in Computer Science (Special) - It just has more Math and I.T. Nothing too special, I suppose.

### Here are some stuff about me:

- Worked Offline Platform Application that utilizes QR Codes and React.
- I'm currently learning the API needed for the Forge Mod Loader.
- Developing games using the Java2D API.
- Presently working on a 3D Multiplayer Card Game.
- Fun Fact: Sleep is a priviledge. Have fun!
